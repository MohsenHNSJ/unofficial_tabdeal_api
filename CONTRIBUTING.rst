How to set up your development environment
------------------------------------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `Unofficial Tabdeal API`_ for local development.

Use `VS Code`_ `Dev Containers`_ extension and clone this repository.

Requirements will be installed automatically

Install pre-commit hooks using :code:`pre-commit install`

Possible issues you may encounter
---------------------------------

If you encounter an error about not setting user.name and user.email for committing with git:

* Run the following commands on your local machine terminal to set-up your git connection

.. code-block:: sh

    git config --global user.name "YOUR_USER_NAME"

    git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"


* Rebuild the container

If you encounter an error about not having the permission to .git/object for committing with git:
:code:`insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database .git/objects`

* Run the following commands on dev container terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo chmod -R a+rwX .

    sudo find . -type d -exec chmod g+s '{}' +

* Check the output of shared repository:

.. code-block:: sh

    git config core.sharedRepository

* If the output of last command is empty or does not include :code:`group` , :code:`true` or :code:`1`, run the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    git config core.sharedRepository group

* Finally, fix the root cause by following the answer from stackoverflow_.
