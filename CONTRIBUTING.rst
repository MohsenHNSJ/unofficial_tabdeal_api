----

.. _Report Bugs:

Report Bugs
-----------

Report bugs on the `Issue Tracker`_.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

.. _Fix Bugs:

Fix Bugs
--------

Look through the `GitHub issues`_ for bugs.
Anything tagged with "bug" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement a fix for it.

.. _Request Features:

Request Features
----------------

Request features on the `Issue Tracker`_.

If you are proposing a new feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

.. _Implement Features:

Implement Features
------------------

Look through the `GitHub issues`_ for features.
Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

.. _Write Documentation:

Write Documentation
-------------------

Unofficial Tabdeal API could always use more documentation, whether as part of the `official docs`_, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

.. _Submit Feedback:

Submit Feedback
---------------

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at `Issue Tracker`_

----

.. _Dev Environment:

How to set up your development environment
------------------------------------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `Unofficial Tabdeal API`_ for local development.

Use `VS Code`_ `Dev Containers`_ extension and clone this repository.

Requirements will be installed automatically

We use Poetry_ for managing virtual environments and dependencies.

For managing linters, static-analysis, and other tools, we use pre-commit_

Install pre-commit_ hooks after cloning, run:

.. code-block:: sh

    pre-commit install

Using pre-commit_ ensures PRs match the linting requirements of the codebase.

.. _Possible Issues:

Possible issues you may encounter
---------------------------------

If you encounter an error about not setting user.name and user.email for committing with git:

* Run the following commands on your **local machine** terminal to set-up your git connection

.. code-block:: sh

    git config --global user.name "YOUR_USER_NAME"

    git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"


* Rebuild the container

If you encounter an error about not having the permission to .git/object for committing with git:
:code:`insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database .git/objects`

* Run the following commands on dev container terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo chmod -R a+rwX .

    sudo find . -type d -exec chmod g+s '{}' +

* Check the output of shared repository:

.. code-block:: sh

    git config core.sharedRepository

* If the output of last command is empty or does not include :code:`group` , :code:`true` or :code:`1`, run the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    git config core.sharedRepository group

* Finally, fix the root cause by following the answer from stackoverflow_.

.. _Documenting:

Documenting your code
---------------------

Whenever possible, please add docstrings to your code!

We use `google-style docstrings`_.

To confirm docstrings are valid, build the docs by running :code:`nox -t docs`

Good docstrings include information like:

1. If not immediately obvious, what is the intended use-case? When should this function be used?
2. What happens during errors/edge-cases.
3. When dealing with physical values, include units.

.. _Testing:

How to test the project
-----------------------

We use the pytest_ framework for unit testing.

Ideally, all new code is paired with new unit tests to exercise that code.

If fixing a bug, consider writing the test first to confirm the existence of the bug, and to confirm that the new code fixes it.

Unit tests should only test a single concise body of code.

Run the full test suite:

.. code-block:: sh

    nox -t test

Lint using Ruff_:

.. code-block:: sh

    nox -t fix

Typecheck using MyPy_:

.. code-block:: sh

    nox -t type

Build and live-preview documentation:

.. code-block:: sh

    nox -t preview

Run pre-commit_ hooks:

.. code-block:: sh

    nox -t pre-commit

List the available Nox_ sessions:

.. code-block:: sh

    nox --list

Unit tests are located in the *tests* directory,
and are written using the pytest_ testing framework.

.. _Coding Style:

Coding Style
------------

In an attempt to keep consistency and maintainability in the code-base,
here are some high-level guidelines for code that might not be enforced by linters:

* Use f-strings.
* Keep/cast path variables as :code:`pathlib.Path` objects. Do not use :code:`os.path`.
  For public-facing functions, cast path arguments immediately to :code:`Path`.
* Avoid deeply nested code. Techniques like returning early and breaking up a complicated function into multiple functions results in easier-to-read and test code.
* Consider if you are double-name-spacing and how modules are meant to be imported.
  E.g. it might be better to name a function :code:`read` instead of :code:`image_read` in the module :code:`my_package/image.py`.
  Consider the module name-space and whether or not it's flattened in :code:`__init__.py`.

.. _Submitting Changes:

How to submit changes
---------------------

Open a `pull request`_ and target the ``dev`` branch to submit changes to this project.

DO NOT target the ``main`` branch, as it is reserved for releases.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains high code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
