Use `VS Code`_ `Dev Containers`_ extension and clone this repository.

Requirements will be installed automatically

Install pre-commit hooks using :code:`pre-commit install`

Possible issues you may encounter
---------------------------------

If you encounter an error about not setting user.name and user.email for committing with git:

* Run the following commands on your local machine terminal to set-up your git connection
